P.24 7.4.1.2 SystemTableObjects parameter
    1 System table index.
    2 Actuator address Highest Byte
    3 Actuator address Middle Byte
    4 Actuator address Lowest Byte
    5-6 Actuator Type (MSBits), Actuator Type (LSBits) â€“ Actuator Sub Type
    7   Bit 0-1 : PowerSave Mode
        Bit 2 : io-Membership
        Bit 3 : RF support
        Bit 6-7 : Actuator Turnaround time.
    8 io-Manufacturer Id
    9 Backbone reference number Highest byte
    10 Backbone reference number Middle byte
    11 Backbone reference number Lowest byte

Normally the only field of interest for the product which interface to the gateway is the
System table index field and Actuator type and sub type field (p.25).

P.104 14 Appendix 2: List of actuator types and their use of Main Parameter and Functional Parameters

Node ID - single device address
Backbone address - address common to all devices connected to the same Powerlink. Is equal to one of the device addresses ... the one managing rf communication !!!

Cmd 36 and 37: is the address sent back with 37 after the address request with 36, the backbone address ? Yes, it is !

Cmd 2a and 2b: 2a is Velux discovery; 2b answer reports:
- 1 CB1
- 2 CB2
- 3-5 Target Node ID
- 6-8 Source Node ID
- 9 CMD
- 10-11 Type/Subtype
- 12-14 Backbone Address
- 15 Manufacturer ID
- 16 Multi info byte
- 17-18 Timestamp ??? (always ffff)

In case of first discovery of a device (device without any controller), the discovery is done using 28 and 29 instead of 2a and 2b. Packets format is the same.



Main and Functional Parameters

Main parameter: 
0x0000    100% Open
0x6400    Force open (disabling rain sensor)
0xC800    0% Open
0xd200    Current (used as stop)
0xD803    Secured ventilation

0xd400    What is it ??? Packet has two bytes more :-(
