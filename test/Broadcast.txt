--- Assumptions to be verified 

As KLI3xx controllers work for different types of devices (e.g. KLI312 can control internal blinds, KLI313 external shutters),
could it be that they send broadcast to any device type they can control ?
In this case, we can suppose that broadcast addresses are built as: 0x00 - type (10 bits) - subtype (6 bits all set to 1)

Is there someone owning a KLI310, universal remote, to double check how many broadcast addresses sends-out during registration ?
